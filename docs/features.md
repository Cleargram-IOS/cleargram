## Legend

- ✅ implemented
- 🔵 planned
- ⚪ upstream already does it — don't reimplement

## Bugfix

| patch | description |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ `bugfix__recent-inline-bots-duplicate-crash` | fix `EXC_BREAKPOINT` crash in `OrderedItemListTable.replaceItems` (debug-only assertion on duplicate IDs) triggered when the server returns the same inline bot in multiple `topPeers` categories. Dedupe `peersWithRating` by `peerId` (keeping the highest rating) before `replaceOrderedItemListItems` in `_internal_managedRecentlyUsedInlineBots` (`submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/TelegramEngine/Peers/RecentPeers.swift`). Stock bug — not caused by cleargram patches; fires after login when the chat list loads. |

## Features

| patch | description |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ `feature__hidden-chats` | hide selected chats from lists, search, recents; suppress notifications; subtract from app badge. Ported from keetgram `76131c1ec7` + presets `c4650d972a` (net diff against `6ad963e5b6`, since keetgram merged origin/master forward). Fork code: `src/swift/ClearGram/TelegramUIPreferences/HiddenChatsSettings.swift` + `src/swift/ClearGram/DebugSettingsUI/QuietChatsController.swift`. |
| ✅ `feature__hidden-messages` | per-message hide via context-menu (gated by an `enabled` toggle); filtered from chat history, in-chat and global search, and shared-media/gif panes without deleting from the server. Ported from keetgram `f2e0edb417` (net diff against `6ad963e5b6` for 8 stock files; the overlapping `ChatListSearchListPaneNode.swift` was already captured by the hidden-chats net diff). Fork code: `src/swift/ClearGram/TelegramUIPreferences/HiddenMessagesSettings.swift` + `src/swift/ClearGram/DebugSettingsUI/QuietChatsController.swift` (management UI). |
| ✅ `feature__camera-picker-video-messages` | front/back camera picker for video messages. Ported from keetgram `4798e9fd8e` (net diff against `6ad963e5b6`, 7 stock files). Build-verified. |

## Debloat

_(none yet)_

## Misc

| patch | description |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ `misc__clear-config` | shared-data keys 30/31/32 (`clearConfigSettings`, `hiddenChatsSettings`, `hiddenMessagesSettings`) added to `submodules/TelegramUIPreferences/Sources/PostboxKeys.swift`. Foundation all fork settings types consume. |

No `misc__branding` patch is needed: `Telegram/BUILD` is already parameterized via
`telegram_bundle_id` (read from `template_minimal_development_configuration.json`), and app
group is derived as `group.{telegram_bundle_id}`. Extensions are disabled via the
`--disableExtensions` CLI flag (free Apple Developer App ID limit), not a patch.

## Planned (not from keetgram)

- `misc__branding` — rename "Telegram" → "Cleargram" in user-visible surfaces (display
  name, Localizable.strings, app icon, launch screen, About). Split into per-surface
  patches. See STATUS.md "Planned" for full scope and what NOT to touch (bundle id, `tg://`
  scheme, MTProto/Passcode protocol strings).
- Cleargram settings panel (Debug menu section or a dedicated screen)
- `ClearConfig` — centralized config object modeled after `InuConfig` (toggle per-feature, default-off)
